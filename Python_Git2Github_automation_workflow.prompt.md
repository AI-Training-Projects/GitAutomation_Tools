Use Python to automate the workflow for 
    Taking a set of local folders and turning them into local git repos.  
    For these new repos, use commit message message "automated initial commit".
    
    If the folder already is a git repo, bring them up to date, i.e., add all recently changed files for staging, and then commit their latest contents with a message "automated initial commit".
    Create Github.com repos with the same name on Github.com 
    Use Github API token for Python to  authenticate into Github.com
    Use git push to push the local repos to Github.com 

    Use try-except blocks for verifying that all steps succeed, or report failure(s) to the console 
    Write a log of all operations out to a file in the folder where the script is run.
